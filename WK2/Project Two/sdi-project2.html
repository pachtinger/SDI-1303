<p>I choose a game theme that is based off of reality of our current situation in America.  It is based around facts of what is going on.  I am creating this game in hopes it will help those of age become aware of politics, the corruption, and theft of our rights and freedoms going on behind those in power, and what are abilities are as people to do something about it.</p>
<p>As you go throught the code of this story, you will see that it is not complete.  Because these are short assignments dealing with particular phases of Javascript, it is formatted in that sense, for example, instead of picking your name, etc, the code will act as if you have already done so to show elements of the required code for the assignment.</p>
<p>As you go through the codes of this game, try to understand also what it is about.  Americans need to be awaken so they can realize their rights and freedoms, and that they are losing them.  This will be one of my first apps when I graduate Full Sail University.  For now, I am doing what I can in SDI Class<em>1303.</em> </p>
